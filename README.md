# BancoLaguna
Project for Metodology Systems II

## Configurations

- Project expects a MYSQL database in "localhost/bancolaguna" (It will auto create tables)
    
    If not using external database comment DB lines in application.properties to fallback to H2

- Install frontend dependencies with "npm install" (in the frontend folder)

- Serve frontend with "npm run serve -- --port 9000" (CORS is expecting the UI to run in that port)

- Currently displaing an example of Veutify in the about section
